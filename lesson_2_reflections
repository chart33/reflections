What happens when you initialize a repo?  Why do you need to do it?
initializing repo creats a .git file for the directory
the .git has all meta data, storing commits, etc.

How is the staging area different from the wokring directory and the repo?
The staging area contains files that will be included in next commit
the wd contains all files, including untracked files
the repository contains all files, and the .git hidden file of meta data

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have only one logical change per commit?
Only have one file in there at a time!
