Why would you want to use a remote repository rather than working locally?
Using a remote repo allows you to work on many machines with easy sharing
It also facilitates collaboration by allowing teammates to push requests from othe machines easily
In addition, you'll always have a backup of your work stored in the cloud in case of emergency

Why might you want always to pull changes manually rather than have Git automatically keep up to date with your remote repo?
Bu pulling manually, you control when features are added so that you can make sure they are complete
it also allows you a chance to stage and try changes before updating

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches
FORKS- give credit to original developer.  exist only on git hub
CLONES- create an exact cope of repo.  Good for collaborators.
BRANCHES- exist within project to indicate different direction you went in terms of dev.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This allows you to compare states and determine what is going on in the project.
This also gives you a safe version locally if another contributor does something to the shared repo
